# GenAIExternship

This repository contains a collection of practical projects completed during the Cognizant 2025 Generative AI Externship Program. Through hands-on work and guided exploration, I developed more real-world skills in AI development, prompt engineering, Python scripting, and responsible technology use.

The externship emphasized applied learning through project-based challenges. 
Through this experience, I:
- Strengthened my Python development skills by building functional, modular command-line applications.
- Explored Generative AI by integrating and experimenting with the Cohere API.
- Gained practical experience in API handling, including authentication, parameter tuning, and response parsing.
- Learned to debug real-world issues, including rate limits, environment variables, and model limitations.
- Enhanced prompt engineering ability by testing how language models respond across different settings.
- Practiced clean coding and error handling, focusing on user input validation and meaningful feedback.
- Documented and evaluated AI outputs to better understand creativity vs. accuracy trade-offs in model behavior.

Overall, the Cognizant Generative AI Externship was an incredible opportunity to build up my technical confidence while applying AI to creative and practical problems. These projects helped me transition from theoretical knowledge to hands-on implementation, reinforcing my interest in AI, product development, and user-focused design.
