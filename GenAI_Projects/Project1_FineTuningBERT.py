# Part 1: Fine-Tuning BERT
# Task: Load, preprocess, and fine-tune BERT on IMDb sentiment analysis
'''
For this project, I fine-tuned a pre-trained BERT model to perform sentiment analysis on the IMDb dataset. 
The dataset was loaded using the datasets library, and I applied Hugging Face's tokenizer to preprocess the text data, 
using padding and truncation to fit the BERT input size (max_length = 128).

From the full 25000 dataset, I selected a subset of 1,000 training samples and 250 test samples for faster runtime. 
The model was fine-tuned using Hugging Face's Trainer API, and I adjusted the training hyperparameters to ensure better performance:
- Learning rate: 3e-5
- Batch size: 8
- Epochs: 2
- Evaluation every 50 steps

Training logs included loss and evaluation metrics. The final model and tokenizer were saved using model.save_pretrained(). 
The process successfully produced a fine-tuned model suitable for binary sentiment classification.

# Part 2: Debugging Issues
# Task: Handle training issues and improve performance
'''
During development, I initially encountered the below error:
TypeError: TrainingArguments.__init__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'evaluation_strategy'.

To resolve it, I updated the transformers library using conda update transformers, which fixed the version compatibility issue.

Later, I saw that the model was underperforming in early evaluations with an accuracy around 51.6%, showing that the predictions were pretty random. 
So, I looked closely at the training logs and changed the hyperparameters to improve performance and:
- Increased learning rate to speed up convergence.
- Reduced batch size to fit system memory constraints.
- Decreased number of epochs to avoid overfitting.

I also printed misclassified samples for error analysis to better understand prediction mistakes.
After all the debugging, the model achieved around 85% accuracy and a 0.84 F1-score, showing significant improvement.

# Part 3: Evaluating the Model
# Task: Visualize performance and extract metrics
'''
The model was evaluated on 250 unseen test samples. 
Specific Evaluation metrics included:
- Accuracy: 0.85
- F1-score: 0.84
- Log loss: Printed in logs
- Confusion matrix: Showed a good balance between positive and negative predictions
- Classification report: Confirmed strong precision and recall for both classes

Model performance improved from 51.6% accuracy to 85% after refinement. Based on these results, no further adjustment was needed for this specific task, 
though additional performance tuning can be implemented for more improvement.

# Part 4: Creative Application
# Task: Apply BERT to a real-world sentiment analysis problem
'''
For the creative application, I applied a fine-tuned BERT model for a real-world NLP task: sentiment classification of IMDb movie reviews. 
The objective was to determine whether a given review expressed a positive or negative sentiment.

I used the pre-trained bert-base-uncased model and fine-tuned it using Hugging Faceâ€™s Trainer API. 
The model was trained on a subset of the IMDb dataset and evaluated on unseen test data. Throughout the process, 
I incorporated key techniques such as frequent evaluation, detailed logging, and misclassification analysis to understand and refine model behavior.

To improve performance and accommodate system limitations, I adjusted hyperparameters such as batch size, learning rate, and evaluation frequency. 
The tokenizer handled input preprocessing, and metrics like accuracy and F1-score guided model tuning.

The final model demonstrated strong performance on real-world text data, showcasing how BERT can be effectively leveraged for practical sentiment analysis. 
Although this implementation used bert-base-uncased, the pipeline is easily extendable to other variants like 
distilbert-base-uncased for faster inference or bert-large-cased for improved accuracy. Additional enhancements such as early stopping or 
mixed precision training could also further boost performance.
